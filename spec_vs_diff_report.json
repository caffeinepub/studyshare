  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-19 and REQ-20 with high fidelity. The backend Book type now includes pdfBase64 and pdfFileName fields, the addBook function is updated, migration.mo is added to handle the schema change, BookCard renders an 'Open Book' button using a Base64 data URI, and the BooksPage upload form replaces the URL fields with a PDF file upload input that reads the file as Base64, displays the filename, and retains all required text fields. The useAddBook mutation passes pdfBase64 and pdfFileName. No significant missing requirements or hallucinated features were found.",
