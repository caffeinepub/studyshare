  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-16, REQ-17, REQ-18) appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-16 adds a deleteNote backend function and a Delete Note button with confirmation dialog on the Note Detail page. REQ-17 adds an Upload Book button and form dialog on the Books page. REQ-18 adds an Open Note button on NoteCard and the Note Detail page. No significant missing requirements or hallucinated features were identified.",

      "reason": "REQ-17 specifies fields: title, author, subject, description, access link, and optional cover image URL. An 'important' flag was not requested but is present in the form state and submitted to the backend.",
